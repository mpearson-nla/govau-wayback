govau-wayback
=============

Lightly modified Wayback machine for use with Australian Government 
Web Archive (AGWA) web application. 

The files in this project are mainly from the Open Source Wayback
Machine version 1.7.1 and come from WAR file *wayback-1.7.1-SNAPSHOT.war*
contained in the root folder of the distribution file
*dist-1.7.1-SNAPSHOT-1.7.1-SNAPSHOT.tar.gz*.

The initial checkin consists of the virgin files from the WAR file
mentioned above. The customisations for use with AGWA are checked in
as a revision so that it is easier to see what has been modified.
